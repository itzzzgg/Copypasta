 The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. Ding  A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Ding  Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, ding

Imagine reading a post, but over the course of it the quality seems to deteriorate and it gets worse and worse, where the sentence structure and grammar reverts to a point of utter nonsense, and you just don't wanna read it anymore (oÂ´Ï‰ï½€o) and the whole ordeal is just awful (Â´ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥`)
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
